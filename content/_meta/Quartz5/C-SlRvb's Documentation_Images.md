## Syntax

```
![[Internal Image.png|attribute attribute2]]
![[Internal Image.png|sban cover hs-med]]

![External Image|attribute attribute2](.png)
![External Image|sban cover hs-med](.png)
```

## Position

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|`left`|Move the image to the left.|
|`right`|Move the image to the right.|
|`center`|Move the image to the center.|

Position Attributes will not work in Live Preview

This causes issues with editing notes so it is and will not be natively supported by me unless that stops occurring. If you're okay with these potential issues, include the `|lp` option to allow it in Live Preview.

I will not attempt to fix any issues that arise out of the use of `|lp`. If something goes wrong with your notes with my theme or snippet, try removing this option before reporting that issue.

## Sizing

|`hfull`|100% horizontally|

|Attributes|Resize Image Width|Relative Sizing|
|---|---|---|
|`wmicro`|70px|10%|
|`wtiny`|100px|20%|
|`wsmall`|200px|30%|

The `relative` attribute will use percentage sizing based on current window size and scale image to that. It only uses the width attributes for sizing.

**Syntax/Formatting**: `![[Image.png|relative wtiny]]`

Place the `|<numbers>` sizing at the _end_ of the text and it will shrink the image to that size.
